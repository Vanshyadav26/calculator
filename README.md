# calculator
I have added code for basic calculator 
The user selects the desired action. Choices 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all acceptable.
To execute a certain segment, two numbers are taken and an if…elif…else branching is employed.
The add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() functions are used to evaluate the corresponding operations.
